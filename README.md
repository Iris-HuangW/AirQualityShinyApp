# AirQualityShinyApp

Description: 
Air polution in Beijing, China has been a serious environment problem endangering health of Beijing residents and facing local industries and governments for decades. This application explores the hidden data patterns and correlations between variables of multi-site air quality stations in Beijing, China. Using predictive modeling prediction, users are able to foresee the PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations and plan for their daily activities. 

DataSource:
